% Get Unaries for all pixels in inputImg, using the foreground and
% background color histograms, and enforcing hard constraints on pixels
% marked by the user as foreground and background
% 
% INPUT :
% - I       : color image
% - hist_fg : foreground color histogram
% - hist_bg : background color histogram
% - seed_fg : pixels marked as foreground by the user
% - seed_bg : pixels marked as background by the user
% 
% OUTPUT :
% - unaries : Nx2 (FG cost and BG cost) matrix containing the unary cost for every pixels in I
